# CSC6301---Project-5
Module 5: Project for CSC6301

## Description
Java program that allows users to continuously enter integers, which are stored in a stack and sorted using an insertion sort algorithm. The sorted elements are stored in a Linked List in ascending order.

## Features
- Uses a stack to store user-inputted integers before sorting.
- Maintains a dynamic Linked List of integers sorted from smallest to largest.
- Continuously takes user input as an integer until the user types "done" into the prompt.
- Returns a sorted Linked List of integers.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed (Download Java).
2. Run sortedstacklinkedlist.java from the command line.
